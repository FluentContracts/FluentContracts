# Contribution Guidelines

As a community, we want to help each other, provide constructive feedback, and make a better product. Of course, our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) must be followed at any time.

## Issues

### Before creating an issue

Evaluate whether your topic is going to be a valid issue:

- Is your issue more of a question? Ask on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/FluentContracts/FluentContracts/discussions))!
- Have you checked existing/closed issues? Is your version behind?
- Have you read the relevant [changelog notes](https://github.com/FluentContracts/FluentContracts/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)?

### When creating an issue

Choose one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/FluentContracts/FluentContracts/issues/new/choose) and fill it out as well as possible. This includes, but is not limited to:

- State the issue as short as possible (more likely there's time to comprehend it)
- Use [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) for code, logs, and other special text fragments
- Don't paste images when they're showing log output or exception messages
- [Refrain from making demands or expressing disappointment](https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing) 

### After creating an issue

Once the `triage` label is removed from your issue, you will know how it is seen from the project's perspective:

>If your issue is labeled as `good first issue`, consider sending a pull-request

The issue will be addressed sooner or later depending on the priority, available time, and your commitment to the project. In rare cases, it might also be closed due to missing resources.

## Pull-Requests

### Before creating a pull-request

In your own interest of getting a pull-request merged (timely):

- Discuss non-trivial changes in an [issue](https://github.com/FluentContracts/FluentContracts/issues/new/choose)
- Make sure your employer allows contributions
- Branch your work off from the `develop` branch
- Get familiar with the coding conventions

### When working on a pull-request

- Aim for qualitative and readable code
- Follow the coding style of the existing codebase
- Make sure the project builds, and all tests pass
- Add tests! We are aiming at high test coverage. PRs without added tests for bugfixes or new functionality will not be accepted

### When creating a pull-request

- [Link the issue it relates to](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (unless it's trivial)
- Check all the applicable boxes

### After creating a pull-request

- Don't bother to rebase your pull-request if commits have been force-pushed
- [Don't "push" your pull-request](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/)
